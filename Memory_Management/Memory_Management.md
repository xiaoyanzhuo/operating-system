# Memory Management
Implement a memory management system(MMS). MMS will handle all requests of allocation of memory
space by different users. Memory allocation algorithms implemented: *First Fit, Best Fit, Worst Fit*.

## Requriments

- MMS will provide the user with an interface for making memory requests and also for freeing up memorythat is no longer needed by the user. One job of MMS is to service user memory requests by matching thesize of the request with a large enough space, from which to satisfy the request. Make sure that the sizeof the memory allocated is in bytes and is in a power of 2.
- Memory allocation and memory deallocation use two functions, one called memory_malloc to allocatememory and the other memory_free to de-allocate the memory. Make sure to know the size of what isbeing freed. The program should have one command-line argument which specifies the number of N ofthreads. When the program starts, it creates N+1 threads The MMS is implemented as a separate thread.Each thread will request the MMS for some memory space, print on the screen “I am thread # thread IDgoing to sleep” and then sleep for some random time and then wakes up and prints on the screen“Thread# ID, waking up” and ask the MMS to release that memory block previously allocated to the thread.
- Make sure cover the case MMS runs out of memory space. In this case, it will choose one or more threadand treats them as the ones that have the lowest priority and forces them to give up allocated memory.Make sure cover the case where you need to merge freed memory holes together to cove the case wherea larger size is needed by some user.
- Make sure cover the case where a very large size requesting thread cannot be accommodated by thesystem, in this case the requesting thread shall be notified with an error notice.

## BackgroundUsing semaphore and mutex to solve multithreading synchronization issue.Memory allocation algorithms implemented in this lab: First Fit, Best Fit, Worst Fit.
- **First Fit**: allocate the first hole that is big enough. First-fit memory allocation is faster in makingallocation but leads to memory waste.- **Best Fit**: allocate the smallest hole that is big enough must search entire list. Unless ordered by size.Best-fit memory allocation makes the best use of memory space but slower in making allocation.- **Worst Fit**: allocate the largest hole that also need to search entire list. Worst-fit memory allocation isopposite to best-fit. It allocates free available block to the new job and it is not the best choice for anactual system.- **Fragmentation/Defragment**: As processes are loaded and removed from memory, the free memory spaceis broken into little pieces. Internal fragment happens when the size allocated is larger than requestedsize and it cannot be compacted. External fragmentation exists when there is enough total memory spaceto satisfy a request but the available spaces are not contiguous: storage is fragmented into a large numberof small holes. In this lab, we will use compaction to achieve defragment.
